configure VLANs

conf t
int f0/2
switchport mode access  (SWITCH PORTS ARE IN ACCESS MODE BY DEFAULT)
switchport ac vlan 1
int f0/3
switch mode ac
switch ac vlan 2
do sh run
we can see switchport mode access command on both interfaces but why don't we see the access vlan 1 we only see 2
this is because of something called as native vlan, in normal vlan the switch tags the packet from that vlan to identify it as belonging to that vlan.
The navtive vlan how ever doesn't need to be tagged and any packets that are untagged are assumed to belong to that vlan. and vlan 1 is the default native vlan on cisco switches because of this by default all interfaces belong to vlan 1. if you try to explicilty configure an interface as vlan 1 it won't even show up in the configuraiton. the native vlan can be changed. for security purposes we ususally change it.

Switch 2

conf t
int f0/2
switchport mode access
swithcport ac vlan 1
int f0/3
switchport ac vlan 2
do sh run


No ping only 1 and 3 can ping bcoz we have configured vlan 1 
SW1 & SW2 are assigned to VLAN 1 so only traffic from VLAN 1 can pass through them

configure interfaces of sw1 and 2 as trunk interfaces to allow traffic from multiple VLANS to pass between 2 switches we must configure their fast ethernet 0/1 interfaces as trunk int
