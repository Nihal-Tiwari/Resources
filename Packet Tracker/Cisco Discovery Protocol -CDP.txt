Cisco Discovery Protocol - it is used to share information about other directly connected cisco equipment such as OS version

Step 1 -
switch 1 should have 1 neighbour R1
R1 should have 2 neighbours R2 and S2

SWITCH 1
en
sh cdp neighbours
device ID is te neighbour 
local interface is the interface of the machine on which it is coneected
Platform is the model of the neighbour device
Port ID is the interface of the remote device - R1


ROUTER 1
en
sh cdp neighbour

ROUTER 2
en
sh cdp neighbour

SWITCH 2
en
sh cdp neighbour


STEP 2 - DCE : Data communications equipments & DTE : Data terminating Equipment 

DCE provides clock rate of the connection

ROUTER 1
en
sh controllers s2/0
R1 is DCE sideof the connection

set clockrate to 64 kilobites per second
conf t
int s2/0
clock rate 64000


STEP 3 

ROUTER 1
end 
sh cdp int
conf t
cdp run = to enable CDP
no cdp run = disable cdp 
do sh cdp neigh
cdp run
do sh cdp neigh = this time no neighbours appear bcox cdp send time is 60 seconds by default 
wait a min and enter the command again 


STEP 6 

bcoz cdp sends infroamtion it is a good practice to disable it on devices 

SWITCH 1
en conf t
int range f0/3 - 4  = We don't want to disable CDP globally so we'll not use no cdp run, configure both interfaces at same time
cdp enable 
no cdp enable 
do sh run == to verify

SWITCH 2
conf t 
int range f0/3 - 4
no cdp enable 
do sh run == to verify


show version == to see the version of the 

sh cdp neigh detail
sh cdp entry R1 == to see details of a particular device
