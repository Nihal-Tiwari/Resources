DHCP - Dynamic Host Conguration Protocol

We will configure R2 as a DHCP server, R1 as a DHCP
client on g0/0 interface and also configure R1 as a DHCP
relay agent

STEP 1
We will configure 3 DHCP pools on R2, 1 for the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet
1 for the 192.168.2.0/24 subnet and 
1 for the connection between R1 & R2

R2
en 
conf t
ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.10
ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.2.1 192.168.2.10

ip dhcp excluded-address 203.0.113.1
(the addresses above are reserved and they won't be assigned)

ip dhcp pool POOL1
network 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
dns-server 8.8.8.8
domain-name google.com
default-router 192.168.1.1

ip dhcp pool POOL2
network 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0
dns-server 8.8.8.8
domain-name google.com
default-router 192.168.2.1

ip dhcp pool POOL3
network 203.0.113.0 255.255.255.252

do sh run | section dhcp (| to filter the output)


PC2
ipconfig /renew
ipconfig /all

Step 2:
R1
en
conf t
int g0/0
ip address dhcp
no shutdown
(R1 will bradcast a dhcp discover message to R2 which 
should reply with a dhcp offer, then R1 send will send
a dhcp request and finally R2 sends sends a DHCP packet which assigns a IP)


CONFIGURING R1 AS DHCP RELAY AGENT for 192.168.1.0/24 subnet
The interface shold be R1's client interface which is PC1

int g0/1
ip helper-address 203.0.113.1  (address of DHCP server)


PC1
ipconfig /renew (do it a few times if it fails it is similar to arp)

ipconfig /all (it has all the info which we configured on R2 ex domain name,etc)
