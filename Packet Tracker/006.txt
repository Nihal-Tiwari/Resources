Ping PC1 <-> PC 2 - WORKS
PC 1 TO 3 - WORKS

STEP 2 

SW 1
en
conf t
int f0/3
switch mode ac
switch ac vlan 2

SW2
en
conf t
int f0/2
switch mode ac
switch ac vlan 2

STEP 3

Remember that by default SWITCH PORTS are access ports in native vlan that is vlan 1
in order for switches to carry traffic form vlan 2 as well so that PC2 & PC 3 can communicate with each other we need to create a trunk

SW1
int f0/1
switchport mode trunk
if only one type of encapsulation is available it works but if it has multiple types of encapsulation available
so we need to configure which type of encapsulation to use

switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
switchport mode trunk

SW2
int f0/1
switch trunk encap dot1q
switch mode trunk
