(A common mistake while enabling port-security.
These interfaces have the default administrative mode of dynamic auto

manually configured as an access port or trunk port)

SW2
(will configure maximum 4 addresses
why 4 addresses even though there are only 3 pcs in the network
It's because SW2 will be receiving CDP messages form SW1 so it will learn SW1's MAC address too)

(We will test sticky learning)
(ping from each PC to R1 so that SW1 and SW2 can learn their MAC addresses)

ping 10.0.0.254 (each PC)

SW2
do sh port-sec int g0/1
do sh run scroll down - you will be able to see MAC addresses of all pc and SW1)
do sh mac address-table (same MAC addresses - notice static even though they are dynamically learned,
this is bcoz of sticky learning)

int vlan 1
ip add 10.0.0.10 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
(if SW1 tries to ping R1 the source MAC address
will be the mac address of VLAN 1,
SW2 learns to mac address of SW1's g0/1 interface,
but it doesn't know the mac address of vlan 1)

do ping 10.0.0.254 (not working)
(bcoz SW2 is blocking the ping bcoz of unauthorized MAC)


SW2
do sh port-sec int g0/1 (violatoin count has increased)

Lets trigger a violation on SW1
PC1
change mac add of pc1
go to config tab
click FastEthernet0
Mac Add - 0001.0001.000A
ping 10.0.0.254 (doesn't work)

SW1
do sh port-sec int f0/1
(Port status: Secure-shutdown)
(Violatoin count: 1)
